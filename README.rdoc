This is my first ralis application that simulates a basic blog application.

The functionalities provided are:

1> Posts page where user can create posts.
2> Comments page where user can write comments for posts.
3> Usage of jquery and ajax to make the user experience interactive.
4> Authentication on creation of new posts by different user.

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
